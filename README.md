# UsingReactHooks
This project uses React hooks to initialize a product and display its properties.
# How to Run
Open the HTML file in a browser.  Make sure all files, are stored in the same directory as the HTML file.  In the terminal, 
navigate to the files' directory, and run "http-server" in that directory.  The output in terminal will indicate the URL to use to
run the code in your browser.
# Usage
When the page loads, the user will see an Initialize button on the screen.  Click the Initialize button, and the browser
should display product information.
# Support
You can email any questions to me at info@codebykatherine.com
# Roadmap for future improvements
I worked on this project in a Fullstack Developer certification course.  I can envision making the project more useful by allowing the user to input product information that could be incorporated.
